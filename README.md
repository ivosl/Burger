# Eat Da Burger! :hamburger:

## Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

## Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page - waiting to be devoured.

## When the user clicks the "Devour it!" button next to the burger, it will move to the right side of the page.

## Once the burger is "Devoured" (moved to the left side of the page), a button "FLUSH IT" will appear below it, so that the user can dispose it.

## Any changes are being instantly updated in MySQL database.


## The application is hosted on Heroku (see the link below): ##
